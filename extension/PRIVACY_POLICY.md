# Privacy Policy for Verdict Helper Extension

**Last Updated: January 2026**

## Overview

Verdict Helper is a browser extension that enables one-click code submission from Verdict.run to Codeforces. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how our extension works.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect
**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.** 

The extension only:
- Reads Codeforces session cookies to check your login status (locally, never transmitted)
- Receives code submission requests from Verdict.run (your code is sent directly to Codeforces, not our servers)

### What We Don't Collect
- No browsing history
- No personal information
- No analytics or tracking
- No user accounts or profiles
- No code is stored by the extension

## Data Transmission

When you submit code through Verdict.run:
1. Your code is sent from Verdict.run → Extension → Codeforces
2. The extension acts as a bridge, not a storage point
3. All communication with Codeforces uses HTTPS

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|------------|----------------|
| `cookies` | To check if you're logged into Codeforces |
| `scripting` | To fill and submit the Codeforces submission form |
| `tabs` | To open Codeforces submit page and track submission status |

- **Codeforces.com** - For code submission (subject to their privacy policy)
- **Verdict.run** - The web application that triggers submissions
