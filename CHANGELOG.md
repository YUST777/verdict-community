## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-22

### 🏗️ Major Refactoring

- **Refactored Problem Page Architecture** — Split the massive 1,200-line `ClientPage.tsx` into 6 modular custom hooks:
  - `useProblemData` — Problem fetching and analytics
  - `useCodePersistence` — Code and language localStorage sync
  - `useCustomTestCases` — User-added test case management
  - `useResizableLayout` — Horizontal panel resizing
  - `useWhiteboardResize` — Whiteboard vertical resizing
  - `useCodeforcesSubmission` — CF submission flow and status polling
  - `useLocalTestRunner` — Judge0 test execution

### ✨ New Features

- **Codeforces Tab** — Added dedicated "Codeforces" tab in the test panel for submission status, verdict tracking, and direct CF links
- **Custom Test Cases** — Users can now add, edit, and delete their own test cases with Zod validation, persisted to localStorage
- **User Submissions** — "My Submissions" now shows only YOUR submissions for the current problem (not all users)
- **Q&A Section** — Added comprehensive FAQ section to the landing page

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Codeforces Submit Logic** — Completely overhauled submission flow for reliable verdict polling via CF API
- **OAuth Google Fix** — Fixed redirect URI from localhost to production domain (thanks to Omar for the issue report!)
- **Navigation Arrows** — Fixed `< >` placement in problem header — now correctly positioned after the problem title
- **Landing Page** — Fixed "Watch Demo" button and mobile hero section video playback issues
- **Responsive Design** — Improved mobile responsiveness across the entire mirror problem interface

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

  - Removed all `any` types → proper TypeScript types
  - Fixed React hooks dependency arrays
  - Removed unused imports and variables
  - Fixed `@ts-ignore` → `@ts-expect-error` with explanations
  - Proper error handling (`catch (error: unknown)`)

### 🧩 Extension v1.0.3

- **Reduced Permissions** — Removed unnecessary permissions for Chrome Web Store compliance
- **Production Ready** — Removed all localhost references, now targets `verdict.run` only
- **Manifest V3** — Fully compliant with latest Chrome extension standards

### 📦 Other Changes
